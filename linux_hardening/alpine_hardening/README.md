**Scored**<br/>
Failure to comply with "Scored" recommendations will decrease the final benchmark score. Compliance with "Scored" recommendations will increase the final benchmark score.<br/>
**Not Scored**<br/>
Failure to comply with "Not Scored" recommendations will not decrease the final benchmark score. Compliance with "Not Scored" recommendations will not increase the final benchmark score.<br/>

**Level 1 - Server**<br/>
Items in this profile intend to:<br/>
    o be practical and prudent;<br/>
    o provide a clear security benefit; and<br/>
    o not inhibit the utility of the technology beyond acceptable means.<br/>
This profile is intended for servers.<br/>
**Level 2 - Server**<br/>
This profile extends the "Level 1 - Server" profile. Items in this profile exhibit one or more of the following characteristics:<br/>
